## Topic
The mini review explores connections between ML and nanoscience

### Data analytics
ML has great utility as recognition / classification tool in nanoscale data.


1. Spectra
	1. Data: X-ray absorption fine structure spectra, generated by molecular dynamics simulations.
	2. Model: ANN
	3. Insight: Chemical structure, atomic ordering, catalytic properties
2. Images analysis
	1. Data: Skyrmions, labeled Lorentz TEM images
	2. Model: Supervised learning, CNN
	3. Insight: Spin
3. Bio-nano
	1. Data: Proteomic information, injection of nanoparticles into rats
	2. Model: ANN
	3. Insight: toxicity of nanoparticles
4. __liquid biopsis__

Also includes:
Deconvolution of mixed signals (ex. scanning probe microscopy) using PCA, LDA, and ICA.
Wafer maps, fault detection in manufacturing of transistors (Metrology for the next generation of semiconductor devices. Nature electronics, potentially my next read)
*The inline metrology currently does not satisfy requirements

### Inverse experiment (Bottom-up approach)

### Nanoscience as a tool to boost ML performance
